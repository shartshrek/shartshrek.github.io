<h2>Inventions</h2>
  
<p>The Flying Shuttle
John Kay

doubles amount of cotton cloth made in a day
The Spinning Jenny
James Hargreaves

Could spin several threads at a time, however the thread was too thin, so it broke (the thread)
Water Frame
Richard Arkwright
1769
Steam power, rollers → to stretch thread before it was spun, tightly woven cotton fabric, durable
Mule
Samuel Orompton
Late 1700s
Steam powered, increased production of durable thread, 10 times faster than, Spinning Jenny + Water Frame = Mule
