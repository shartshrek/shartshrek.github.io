Effects of the Industrial Revolution
World Transformed
Great brit went through drastic change in 1700 and 1800s
Steam powered engines replaced human and animal labour in industrial age
A lot of migrants from the countryside came to work in the industrial places. The cities become crowded and the housing isn't good.
Great britain led the charge in 1700s with steam power, coal, and cotton manufacturing. In 1800s US leads the charge with steel, electricity, oil,  and gas.
Pros and cons of Industrial revolution; 	
Pros: millions of lives improved by making goods more accessible and affordable. New employment opportunities, capitalism soared
Cons: huge inequality in wealth. Many factory owners hella rich but workers broke. Also dangerous working conditions, broken things just left like that and people got hurt. Longer work days with no benefit and no legal protection. Major environmental impact and pollution.
Patience kershaw speaks out
Primary source of working conditions for children in england during the industrial revolution
She also inspired lord ashley- a british philanthropist, politician, and social reformer. He was powerful and helped free children from stuff
Child labor
Children made to work dangerous jobs - factories, mines to help support their families
Factories preferred to employ kids because they were smaller, easier to beat, and cost less. They also did work that adults refused to do. Orphanages rented out children
Poor house sent their kids to work. Basically the people in Poor house were in debt and sent their kids to work. But the children didn tmake much and the debt increased more and more.
Sick families also sent their children to work. 
Changes for everyone
Reformers eventually helped to pass laws to protect women and children from unsafe work conditions
Inspectors come by to inspect mines and factories. If working conditions aren’t safe, owners heavily fined.
Children made to go to school, public school and stuff started to get made. Recreational clubs are places where children that dont work could go while their parents at work.
Men were still at the mercy of their employers and if they get sick or injured they lose their job.
Workers starved for a better life for them and their children
America became a place where opportunities seemed abundant. People left their homes to find a better life and future which cause a wave of immigration
Many people chose to stay and fight which caused a lot of reform and this era of reform caused the creation of unions to protect worker’s right.
The Industrialists
Factories and mine owners also fought for their rights→they felt that changes were unfair to them and their livelihood→the government shouldn’t have the right to interfere in the free exchange of goods and labor→free market. It is an economic system based on competition between private businesses (government doesn’t control prices)
Many indrustrisalists thought the economy would fix itself if left alone→a lot of industrialist tend to become very wealthy→the wealth got them influence→influence led to political power. You can buy a goevrnment
Before the Industrial Revolution
Serfdom was no longer in england in the 1400s
Serfs→a serf is bound to the land on which they work on. Serfdom ends and everybody becomes villagers. People then move to different plots of land and the people with less people gets their land bought from them by other land owners. 
Some villagers that were better became yeoman and bought their own farms.
Some yeomen became more wealthy and owned larger plots of land. They had landlords to manage that land.
Gentry are the wealthy landowners and the elite.
The majority of people living in rural england were stuck as villagers
A Hard Life
Most english people worked from sunrise to sunset to produce enough foo to survive
Changing seasons and weather could mean life or death
produc e and animal products of yeoman
Rye, barley, oats, and wheat were staples in good weather; they were taken to mills to be ground into flour→flous baked into bread and sold at market or made into mush and eaten as porridge
Vegetables and herbs grown in gardens
Eggs from chickens, duck, and geese
Some people lucky enough to live on land w/ fruit trees and beery bushes;
some live by water with fish
Cream butter milk from goats and cows; wool too
Anything extra would make even more money
They would sell their goods in warmer months; 
things they dont have they would buy or trade
Seasons
In winter, every villager was not well off enough to survive winter so they slaughtered their animals to feed their family
In spring, they would trade goods at market, plough fields in prep. For harvest. They would use an ox or manually plough it. Also spent a lot of time fending off pests. People could not hunt animals on noble’s land even if they were eating their crops.
The Harvest
Men usually harvested in a laborious way; they used a scythe and they would cut down the wheat. They waited for it to dry and beat in on a rock. The inside went everywhere and they had to go collect it.
In rural life everything depended on the success of the harvest
Malnutrition was common amongst the poor and it led to sickness and disease such as measles, whooping cough, and chickenpox. Medicines were herbal remedies and praying.
Daily life before modern times
Most villagers lived in a large house with a dirt floor and low ceilings
Whole family slept on one area w/ homemade furniture; bathrooms outside and buckets to collect rainwater/ some family had wells or stream
No schools or hospitals; there was a town doctor that could make house calls. Because of this, many people were illiterate and relied on priests for information. Church was largest building in town. 
Yeomen would hire dayworkers; a villager family would work for a gentry family. Dayworkers would tend to the land, build, and stuff like that. Women do household chores and cook, kids hered animals and chased pests away
The Powerless Poor
Most villagers had no say in the government or power to change theri lives and were usually put down by force
But new technology brought changes
Moving Toward the Industrial Age
New Ways of Farming
Inventors discoverd new and more effective ways to work; they saved hours and made new stuff
New foods broght from the Americas
Potatoes grew well in Great Britain
Corn fed the livestock and made them bigger and stronger; people didnt think corn was edible but then made it edible
Tobacco and chocolate were available to those who could afford it
Livestock grew bigger and stronger thanks to an increase in food and breeding practices
People were also healthier and stronger than their ancestors due to better food
New farming tools made out of metal → more durable and stronger; yeoman and villagers profited from it
Farming techniques made harvesting more efficient and profitable
Improved roads and new canals=better transportation of goods
Improvement in water wheels=mills ground more flour
Enthusiasm for more change
The Enclosure Movement
The english landscape changed with the enclosure movement
Pasterus fenced in and designated for sheep→wool production increased with a higher demand for cloth
The wasy the enclosure movement worked is thstat it lumped together smaller plots of land and one owner for it and cost for producing crops fell; fewer farmers needed but the farmers cant charge as much for their vegetables
Landlords wealthier and villagers out of work
Villagers left rural areas for cities to work for mines and factories and some even left britain to move to american colonies
New Wayd of Mining and Making Metal Tools
By 1700s timber a firewood in england had fimished and coal was taking its place→hotter and burned longer and could soften iron
Iron was sued to make better tools for farming and processing goods→iron used in bridges, machinery, → canals, and deepen harbors, increased investment in iron
Miners dug shafts to mine iron ore→they oftentimes flooded with groundwater which made it dangerous and fatal to work there→so they made a pump to pump the water out→steam engine
Early steam pumps were heavy and hard to move
James watt makes imrpvements on the steam engine in 1768; he made it smaller, more powerful, and more portable; his steam engine could power other machines through gears, pulleys, and belts by the 1780s due to more improvements
Richard Trevethicks made the steam engine (beginning of the train)(locomotive) in 1804
Robert Fulton adds the steam engine to a boat and creates the steamboat in 1807→revolutionized transportation in the US
Other inventors created machines to harvest what, spin thread, weave cloth, and help forge iron.
The production of iron resulted in creation of railroads, bigger ships, bridges and barges,(floating flat surface used to haul stuff), looms, and machines. Machines replacing humans
From Farm to Factories and Cities
Modern Urban Culture
Large cities are common now but 300 years ago they werent
More People Than Ever Before
Between 1100 and 1300 europe’s population grew but declined over the next few hundred years
Plagues, wars, and food shortages killed a large part of the population
By 1500s→more people because of renaissance, people have more resistances to the plague, and more people bring other foods bcause of exploration and farming techniques
By 1700s another wave of population→immigration and longer life expectancy because of better hygiene and food supply. 5 million to 8 million in england
Europeanss living in north america went from 475,000 to 4 million people by 1790
Indigenous populations drastically decreased because of European warfare and illnesses
Decrease of jobs in countryside with the population increase, many people migrate from villages to cities
This massive migration was a major historical event in the millenium
It Started in England
Manchester was considered a large town in 1700s with 10k people but by mid 1800s increased to 300k people because of migration
City grew rapidly and became a center for factories and commercial activities
Barges brought in iron and coal into the city and 
In 1830 a railway linked Manchester and liverpool. Liverpool was a port city which got a lot of goods. It was on the west side and had access to the americas. Liverpool transported manchester’s cloth around the world
Changes in Cloth
Manchester known for their wool and cloth because of enclosure movement and they started making a material called fuschan; it was durable and soft and didnt shrink and they didnt want anybody else to know how to make it
Before industrial revolution wool production was usually done at home and it was very tedious but then machines started to make cloth better and faster and made many home-knitters have to move to cities
Inventors and Inventions
In 1730s john kay invented the flying shuttle. 
The machine doubled the amount of cotton cloth that could be produced in a day
Now thread production needs to increase to keep up with the demand
In 1764 James Hargreeves invents the Spinning jenny
This machine could spin multiple threads at the same time as opposed to 1 at a time.]
However this machine was too strong and sometimes the threads popped
In 1769 richard arkwright invented the water frame which 
It used steam power to drive rollers that stretched the thread before it was spun which strengthens the thread.
By the end of the 1700s samuel crompton had a better idea and combined the spinning jenny and the water frame and created the spinning mule. It made thin and finely woven threads; increased production of threads by 10x
Cotton took over wool 
The Cotton Gin
In 1793 an american inventor Eli Whitney expanded on the cotton gin
Efficientized the increased separation of the husk and the seed.
Changed agriculture int he american south and huge cotton plantations now being made→at one point cotton was called “white gold” and plantation owners because rich.
Factories Instead of Cottages
Factories greater than cottage industry, british weavers drop 250k to 50k in 30 weavers
But fabric was quicker and cheaper to make but jobless people desperate for jobs
Factory owners cared more about manufacturing techniques, machines, and money than they did their workers
Workers under constant pressure and supervision 
Sworn to secrecy
Worked long hours sometimes into the night and 
they had no job security
Work dangerous conditons for little pay
English landscape became dominated by facotires
Villagers had to leave their homes to bigger cities hoping for a better life but it wasnt guaranteed, 9/10 worse than when they left
Housing shortages in overcrowded areas→factory owners rente dout cheap housing(slums)-->some owners had multiple properties 
Because of the power of the factory owners most people felt they were helpless; factory owners could blacklist people
Poor sanitation; poop everywhere, trash everywhere, not enough facilities for people; crime and murder rates went up and now there was a police force instead of just 1 policeman per city. Scarce food as well. Drunkenness in public was also a crime now.
If you had enough money and you thought the place stinks you could move out of the city but close enough to be close to your business
The Rise of Capitalism
Great Change in Business
Villages transformed into big cities
Development of capitalism caused major changes and grew to be a major economic system
What is Capitalism?
Capital is the money that is invested into the creation and development of a business
capitalism
Economic system where resources and businesses are privately owned and prices are not controlled by the government
Stimulates production of cheaper and more efficiently produced goods and services
Capitalists are people who participate in capitalism by selling goods or services and investing money in businesses in order to make more of a profit on their investment
These capitalists have to consider what the market wants in order to know what they need to invest in
The determination to make more money drives the search for more business opportunities and the more money a worker makes the more they work to get more stuff
According to capitalists the best use of money is to make more money by investing with it
Mercantilism walked so capitalism could fly
Mercantilism
Economic system that aims to increase a country’s wealth and power by controlling trade and people
England, france, spain, and portugal became rich during the age of exploration which was between the 1500 and 1700s;
 they plundered the americas and grew wealthy by using free labor on plantations and mines
This was organized piracy; they stole materials from a land that wasn't theirs
They also brought goods from colonies to sell at europe at an increased profit
The more control over trade the more powerful the country was and rival nations would have to buy goods from a more powerful and influential country
To be a powerful country a nation has to export goods than their importing
Money made from exports can be invested back into the country
Infrastructure, transportation, mines, crops, deepening harbors, strengthening miliraty
Tariffs imposed on imported goods
Goods more expensive so people stopped buying them as much


The Need for Colonies
Establishing control of colonises was essntial to be a dominant force in a mercantilist economy
Colonies provided raw material, natural resources, and cheap labor.
People living in the colonies became a market because you could charge them taxes and was allegedly for protecting them
The richer the colony, the richer the colonizing country.
Because of this, you had to keep your colonists in vcheck anc strict laws to not trade with other foreign colonies.(to prevent them to get stronger)
Colonists not supposed to start their own industries in the colony because this could pose competition for the colonizing country.
Colonists had no say in the government which they were paying taxes to
During mercantile era agriculture and manufacturing important in the colonizing country as well
The government did support new industries in its country and encouraged banks to invest in them
They also created a national currency with weights and measures that made trade easier
New business ideas continues to emerge
